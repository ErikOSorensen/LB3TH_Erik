## About This Site

This site serves as a lab notebook where I document my experiments, projects, and learnings. The content is organized into:

- **Lab Notes**: Chronological entries documenting experiments, measurements, and discoveries
- **Projects**: Longer-term efforts that may span multiple lab sessions
- **My Lab**: Overview of my workspace and equipment
