So I decided to build a resistive \nRF power tap. Wes Hayward, W7ZOI, and Bob Larkin, W7PUA, showed how to do\nthis in their original  paper on their AD8307 power meter (in QST, June 2001).\n\n\n# Build\n\nHayward and Larkin's design is built into a die cast aluminium box with\nconnectors on three sides. I used the same type of box (sourced from ebay),\nand put BNC connectors (with flanges) on.  I have built a version aiming\nfor 40 dB attenuation, as in this picture:\n\n![Picture of power tap](images/LRM_20220416_155352.jpg){width=600px}\n\nThere are two weaknesses with this current version. First, the resistors\ncannot withstand a lot of power, so this is a proof of concept. If there\nare 100W in the through line, there will be almost 2W divided on the 3\n820 ohm resistors going down from the line. I should order some resistors\nthat are more beefy. Second, I haven't installed a metal plate as the through\nconnection. Hayward and Larkin used a brass plate to connect through\nfrom the input to the output, which I guess would balance the inductance\nin the through connection with capacitive coupling to ground (they also used\na short wire stub in parallel with the resistors). I tried fabricating\nsuch a plate out of a sardine tin, but I suspect that was made out of aluminium\nand it wouldn't solder. I tried to make one out of scap pcb material, but\nthat seemed very stiff and a mechanical problem without more support. So I decided\nto see how it would work with low power and without any attempt at high frequency \ncompensation. \n\n\n# Return loss at input port (S11)\n\nI terminated the output and the sample tap in 50 ohm dummy loads, and put the\nnanoVNA on the input point. I used my fancy Mini-Circuit 50 ohm terminator on\nthe output and calibrated the nanoVNA for a sweep 1-500 MHz. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nExamination of the Smith chart on the NanoVNA confirms that the all complex\nimpedance is on the inductive side, indicating that it is the lack of capacitance\nin my build that is a problem at higher frequencies. Still, the return loss\nat 145 MHz is 19 dB, making it useful also at VHF. Hardware tweaking can perhaps\nmake it acceptable also at the lower UHF frequencies. I'll get back to it when\nI have received some beefier 820 ohm resistors for a permanent build.\n\n# Attenuation (S21)\n\nI reconfigured the testing setup: Kept the 50 ohm termination on the output,\nbut connected the NanoVNA for a two port measurement - from the input port\nto the tap (the attenuated output). I recorded the \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAttenuation is very close to the nominal 40dB.\nThis curve looks dramatic, but considering the scale, attenuation is\nflat up to and including VHF, only drops off by a couple\nof dB at 500 MHz. \n\n# Conclusion\n\nFancy high frequency corrections would be nice, but is not strictly necessary\nfor operation at the 144 MHz band and lower. Mouser sells 820 Ohm resistors, 2W for\nabout 10kr a piece. I would need 3 of these - I have 50 Ohm terminating resistors,\nand this doesn't have to drop as much power.\n\n\n\n",
