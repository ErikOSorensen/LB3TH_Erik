This should be straight from the satelite\nfeed, so if I use my inaccurate counter to measure the period of the 1pps \nsignal, I can get a hang on how far off my counter is and calculate a correction\nfactor. Then I'll measure my Oscilloquartz units at different control voltages to\nsee if it looks like they are able to get 10MHz into their control range.\n\n# Measuring the 1pps GPS signal\n\n\n\nI have never measured periods with my counter before, and I struggled initially to \nfind the right sensitivity and trigger level. On my scope, I found that the 1pps \npulse was a square 100ms long pulse at 3.3V. In the end I set the trigger level to 1V manually,\nand this worked fine. I made 20 measurements of the period, and found and average period\nof 1.00000023427 seconds, with a standard deviation of 4.54e-09. So it \nseems that the oscillator of my counter is running a bit high.\n\n\n\n\n# Measurement of oscillators\nI mark the oscillators \"A\" and \"B\" to keep them apart. \n\nI measure them in three states: 1) Without touching the control voltage  (CV) pin (in which case I can measure 4.4V on the pin), \n2) shorting the CV pin to the voltage reference (VR) pin, which should be around 8V (I measure a bit lower), and 3) shorting VC to GND. \nBefore measurement I let the oscillators warm up by noticing when the current draw went from 0.5A to around 0.2A and then give them\na couple of additional minutes to stabilize.\n\n\n\n\nTo determine the reliability of my measurements, I should take into account the errors involved\nin my measurement of the GPS period. Assuming independence in these\nestimates, the formula for the variance of a product \nis \n$$ var(XY) = var(X)var(Y) + var(X)E(Y)^2 + var(Y) E(X)^2,\n$$\nso based on two vectors of measurements, I should be able to calculate\nthe estimated standard error of the product using this function: \n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nse_product <- function(X,Y) {\n  vxm <- var(X)/length(X)\n  vym <- var(Y)/length(Y)\n  ex <- mean(X)\n  ey <- mean(Y)\n  vxy <- vxm*vym + vxm*ey^2 + vym*ex^2\n  sqrt(vxy)\n}\n```\n:::\n\nAfter correcting for the error in the counter, \nthese are my measurements and estimated error-bars:\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'unit'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe error-bars really are that vertically compressed...\n\nWhat to conclude?\n\n1. The 8V of control voltage does seem to create a reasonable tuning range of the oscillator, in  both units. \n2. Unit \"A\" has drifted to far to be useful. Even if it probably possible to put up to 10V (2 above the VR level), this won't be sufficient to get unit A up to 10 MHz. I don't know what other uses I can find for this oscillator, so yes, it seems like this oscillator is too old to be useful.\n3. Unit \"B\" is in much better health, about 2V at the VR pin should get this unit to 10MHz. \n\n\n\n",
