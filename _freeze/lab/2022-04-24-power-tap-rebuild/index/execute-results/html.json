I didn't have metal film resistors that could take the full power of a\n100W transmitter.\n2. The plate-capacitor through coupling didn't seem very sturdy, and I made\na through connection with a straight wire that was a tad bit on the inductive \nside.\n\n# Build\n\nNow I have received 2W metal film resistors from Mouser, and I have built the\nplate capacitor solution with a piece of circuit board material that is held\nin place with nylon bolts. This is mechanically quite secure:\n\n![Picture of inside of tap](images/LRM_20220424_181713_small.jpg)\n\n# Measuring with NanoVNA Saver\nI figured out how to connect the nanoVNA to the computer with [NanoVNA Saver](https://github.com/NanoVNA-Saver/nanovna-saver). This allows me to\neither save a screenshot of what I saw while watching the tiny screen when\nI adjusted the length of the small wire capacitor that is parallel to the\npower resistors:\n\n![NanoVNA screenshot](images/VNA_screenshot.png)\n\nThis shows that the power tap works quite well from 1 to 500 MHz, minimum\nreturn loss is almost 21 dB, at 440 MHz. The through insertion loss is very small.\n\n# Attempts to load NanoVNA touchstone files into R\n\nThere is a package by Aaron Anderson, [rftk: RF Toolkit](https://github.com/aaronmanderson3/rftk) that supposedly can read\ntouchstone files, do RF calculations and display data using ggplot. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rftk)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow, it should be possible to read the touchstone files saved by NanoVNA saver:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_thru <- read_snp(\"40dB_pad.s2p\")\ndf_pad <- read_snp(\"40dB_pad_attenuation.s2p\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can take a look at the content of one of these files:\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhead(df_thru)\n```\n:::\n\nThe S12 and S22 parameters are not available in from the Nano VNA.\n\nSo we can now plot the return loss and insertion loss of a through \nconnection:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nSimilarly, I have another set of measurement, with the VNA from\ninput to the attenuated tap (and 50 ohm termination of output).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nIn theory, it should also be possible to plot these data on a Smith chart,\nthere is a `geom_smith` extension to ggplot.\nThe required aesthetics to the `geom_smith` are `freq`, `smag`, and `sang`.\nFrequency must be in Hz. From the example in the help, it is clear that `sang`\nis angle in radians (whereas the file was read with angles in degrees). \nI suspect that the `smag` might be the magnitude of the \nreflection coefficient, in which case $$|\\Gamma| = 10^{S_{11}/20},$$\nwith $|\\Gamma|$ being the magnitude of the reflection coefficient.\nLet's try to put that into the Smith chart command.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nAnd for the attenuation output:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI suspect that there are commands in `rftk` to do the conversion between\nS-parameters and reflection coefficient, but it seems as if the documentation\nis still not finished.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
