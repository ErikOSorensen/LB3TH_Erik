I'm not sure I like this, as \nthe weatherproofing amalgamating tape hasn't got a lot of space in between the contact area and the terminal \nhousing. Let's see how long it can last in the Bergen weather. The coax to my entry point is only 5 meters, so\nreplacing it is not a major cost. \n\nMounting the Yagi to the speaker stand wasn't as diffiult as I had worried it would be. The speaker stand has\na diameter of 38mm, while the mounting bracket must have been made for a tube at least 50mm. But when I tighten\ndown the bolts, there isn't a lot of play, so I hope it will stay put. \n\nThe Eantenna Yagi is fed with a full-wave loop. Two elements are mounted to the boom (the back one with a plastic\nspace for insulation) about 18 cm apart. Between the ends of the elements are aluminium connecting U-elements mounted with hose clamps,\nand the antenna is tuned by adjusting how far in the U-elements are pushed before they are tightened down. I used my nanoVNA\nas an antenna analyzer centered at 145 MHz with a 10 MHz span. I measured from the outside of the U-element to the edge of\nthe mounted elements and noted the return loss in dB at 144.2 MHz. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI couldn't replicate that measurement of a fantastic return loss of 25 dB at 5cm, but as the return loss\nis approaching 20dB, measurements are very sensitive to the local environment. In the end, I went with\njust a tad more than 5 cm, corresponding to about 17.4 dB return loss (or a vswr of about 1.3:1) or better \nacross all of the 2m band.\n\n![nanoVNA after tuning antenna, sorry for the reflections.](images/20201206_133139.jpg)\n\nThis is what the antenna look like pointing approximately south from Landås: \n\n![2m antenna pointing south.](images/20201206_133616.jpg)\n\nAnd this is what the baby loop looks like, mounted on the same type of (temporary) speaker stand: \n\n![Baby loop on the balcony.](images/20201206_133623.jpg)\n\n",
